# Cosmos data indexer

Ths repository contains a Cosmos block and transaction indexer.

## Getting started

This code is written in dotnet 6 which is available cross platform.

Ensure that you have the latest dotnet 6 SDK installed and Docker (+docker compose), then getting started is as simple as:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

And then run the API

```bash
dotnet run --project src/ServiceHost/ServiceHost.csproj
```

The default launch-settings _will not_ start downloading data, as this is both CPU and network heavy.
If you want to download data, edit the file `src/ServiceHost/Properties/launchSettings.json` and add 
`BACKGROUND_WORKER` to the `SAPIENT_SERVICE_ROLES_ENABLED` config variable.

## Code Structure

The solution structure is based on the [Clean Architecture pattern](https://github.com/ardalis/cleanarchitecture)
which is also described
as [Common web application architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures#clean-architecture)
by Microsoft.

## The origin of the project

This project started life as the `Pylon Board` (which was also created by us), but since the crash of Terra Classic, we have decided to branch out and make this a `Cosmos` thing instead.
